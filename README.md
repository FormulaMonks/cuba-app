Cuba App
========

This is a sample application using [Cuba](http://cuba.is) and
[Mote](https://github.com/soveran/mote).


Getting started
---------------

Clone this repository and install the gems listed in `.gems`. If you want to
make your life easier, run `gem install dep` first, then `dep install`.

Testing
-------

Tests are located in `/test` and they use
[Cutest](https://github.com/djanowski/cutest/) and
[Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara). You will find a very basic
example that checks the homepage for certain content.

More information

Meet us on IRC at #cuba.rb on freenode.net.
